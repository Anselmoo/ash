Each directory in here is a separate benchmarking database for molecular reactions.
Each directory, e.g. IE-benzenes should contain a README file and a directory called data.
The README file should contain human-readable basic information about the dataset.
The data directory should contain XYZ-files for the dataset and a file: "Reference_data.txt" that contains definitions about the reactions.

Example:

"IE-benzenes" data-set:
    => README
    => data
        => benzene-neut.xyz
        => benzene-ox.xyz
        => etc.
        => Reference_data.txt


The Reference_data.txt contains information about the reactions in the following format
- The #TESTSET_INFO lines contain information on the number of reactions and the unit for the reference data.
  These special lines are read and parsed by ASH.
- Other # lines are convenient comment-lines but are not read by ASH.
- Each numbered line defines a reaction. The ASCII-string words in the line point to XYZ-files in the same dir
  while the integers indicate the stoichiometry of the reaction (negative number: reactant, positive number: product).
  The last floating point number is always the reference value (e.g. experimental value) in the unit indicated in the #TESTSET_INFO line. 

Reference_data.txt Example :

#TESTSET_INFO Numentries: 5
#TESTSET_INFO Unit: eV
#X-benzenes. Geometries: B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP
1 fluorobenzene-neut fluorobenzene-ox -1 1 9.2032
2 benzene-neut benzene-ox -1 1 9.24378
3 chlorobenzene-neut chlorobenzene-ox -1 1 9.0728
4 bromobenzene-neut bromobenzene-ox -1 1 8.9975
5 iodobenzene-neut iodobenzene-ox -1 1 8.7580
